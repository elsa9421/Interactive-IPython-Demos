# Interactive-IPython-Demos
This repository includes a collection of IPython Notebooks developed from June 2020 through August 2020.  These notebooks were developed by me for the Machine Learning Course EECS 545 taught by Prof. Clayton Scott at UMich for Fall 2020. Any references used are inlcluded in the notebooks. Most of the IPython demos (Google Colab) are interactive, enabling Data Visualization for Machine Learning algorithms.
